# Local Food Prices

This is a display of the food price data used in the paper "Local Food Prices, SNAP Purchasing Power, and Child Health"
by Erin Bronchetti, Garret Christensen, and Hilary Hoynes. Send questions to Garret Christensen, or download the code from [Github](http://www.github.com/garretchristensen/Food_Price_Maps).

The data originally comes from the USDA's Quarterly Food at Home Price Database ([QFAHPD](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/quarterly-food-at-home-price-database/)).
We follow the method described in Gregory, Coleman-Jensen (2013--[published](https://academic.oup.com/aepp/article/35/4/679/8547/Do-High-Food-Prices-Increase-Food-Insecurity-in), [OA](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1850545)) to turn regional data on food category prices into a single regional index modeled after the Thrifty Food Plan.
