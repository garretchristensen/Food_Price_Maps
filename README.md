# Food Price Maps

This is the code for an R Shiny app showing maps and histograms of the cost of food nationwide. 
Play with the (mildly) interactive maps at http://garretchristensen.shinyapps.io/Food_Price_Maps. 

Code written by [Garret Christensen](http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~garret) for research with Hilary Hoynes and Erin Bronchetti. 
Data comes from the USDA's [Quarterly Food at Home Price Database](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/quarterly-food-at-home-price-database/).
